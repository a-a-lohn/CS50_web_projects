Consistent problems
-Styling (from style.css) does not display in web browser, tried bypassing cache using CRTL+F5
-Use a virtual env next time

Solved problems
-How to untrack files already added (to index): http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/01/Untrack-files-already-added-to-git-repository-based-on-gitignore/
-How to run code in Python3 instead of Python2 (i.e. without import errors):
add "code-runner.executorMap.python": "python3 -u" in .vscode/settings.json (or in a more general spot,

-Env variables reset between uses: set env variables directly in app.py
-init.sh does not run: no need
-Add to requirements.txt: done
